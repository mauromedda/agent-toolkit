# Gemini Review Skill

**Full details**: `references/workflow.md`

Invoke Gemini for collaborative design and code review.

## 🚨 SELF-CHECK: Call Gemini Now?

**Run this checklist BEFORE running tests, summarizing, or committing:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  GEMINI REVIEW REQUIRED?                                    │
│                                                             │
│  Count your changes:                                        │
│  □ Modified/created more than 3 files with logic changes?   │
│  □ Wrote more than 100 lines of code?                       │
│  □ Touched security or performance code?                    │
│                                                             │
│  ANY YES → STOP AND CALL GEMINI NOW                         │
│  ALL NO  → Skip Gemini, proceed to tests                    │

## 🔄 RESUMED SESSION CHECKPOINT

**When a session is resumed from context compaction, STOP and check:**

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  SESSION RESUMED - MANDATORY VERIFICATION                        ║
║                                                                  ║
║  Before continuing ANY work, answer these questions:             ║
║                                                                  ║
║  1. Was I in the middle of implementing code?                    ║
║     → Check the summary for "in progress" or "pending" tasks     ║
║                                                                  ║
║  2. How many files were modified before compaction?              ║
║     → Run: git diff --stat                                       ║
║                                                                  ║
║  3. Did I already call Gemini for review?                        ║
║     → Search summary for "gemini" or "code review"               ║
║                                                                  ║
║  If implementation was in progress AND Gemini wasn't called:     ║
║  → CALL GEMINI FIRST before continuing implementation            ║
║                                                                  ║
║  If implementation is complete but tests weren't run:            ║
║  → Check thresholds (>100 lines OR >3 files) → Call Gemini       ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**Why this matters:** Context compaction loses awareness of the workflow state.
The summary may say "continue with X" but omit that Gemini review was pending.

**Resume workflow:**
```
1. Session resumes with summary
2. ★ STOP - Read summary carefully ★
3. Check: Was implementation in progress?
4. Check: git diff --stat for change count
5. If thresholds met AND no Gemini review recorded:
   → Call Gemini BEFORE continuing
6. Then proceed with the task
```

## When to Invoke (MANDATORY)

| Trigger | Timing | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Session resumed/compacted** | **IMMEDIATELY on resume** | Check thresholds |
| New feature request | BEFORE proposing solutions | Design review |
| Architectural decision | BEFORE proposing solutions | Architecture review |
| **Architectural review/analysis** | **BEFORE presenting recommendations** | Architecture review |
| **>100 lines changed** | **IMMEDIATELY after implementation** | Code review |
| **>3 files with logic changes** | **IMMEDIATELY after implementation** | Code review |
| Security-related code | IMMEDIATELY after implementation | Security review |
| Performance optimization | IMMEDIATELY after implementation | Performance review |
| Cross-service debugging | WHEN data flows between services | Debug review |
| Frontend/Backend alignment | WHEN form data doesn't match API | Alignment review |

**🚨 CRITICAL - Post-Implementation Checkpoint:**
- "IMMEDIATELY after implementation" means BEFORE:
  - Running tests
  - Providing summaries to the user
  - Moving to the next task
  - Committing changes
- If you've just finished writing code across multiple files, STOP and call Gemini NOW
- The checkpoint triggers on IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION, not on commit intent

**Self-check phrases that should trigger review:**
- "I've implemented..." / "I've added..." / "I've modified..."
- "Let me run the tests" / "Let me commit" ← STOP! Check threshold first!

**CRITICAL**: After codebase exploration, if you are about to produce **recommendations, suggestions, or analysis with actionable items**, you MUST call Gemini first. "Proposing solutions" includes architectural reviews that recommend changes.

## When to Skip

- <100 lines AND ≤3 files with only mechanical changes
- Mechanical changes: imports, formatting, version bumps
- Documentation-only changes
- String constant propagation

## How to Invoke

**Command format:**
```bash
gemini -m gemini-3-pro-preview "Your review prompt here" .
```

**CRITICAL - Model Selection:**
- **ALWAYS use `gemini-3-pro-preview`** - this is non-negotiable
- Do NOT substitute with other models:
  - ❌ `gemini-2.5-pro` (older model, less capable)
  - ❌ `gemini-2.5-flash` (different tier)
  - ❌ `gemini-3-flash-preview` (different tier)
- If `gemini-3-pro-preview` fails, **report the error to the user** rather than silently using a different model

**CRITICAL - Execution:**
- Always use `timeout: 1800000` (30 min) in Bash tool call
- NEVER run as background task; wait for completion synchronously
- Always provide `.` as final parameter for codebase access

## Review Prompts by Type

### Design Review (BEFORE implementation)

```bash
gemini -m gemini-3-pro-preview "I need to implement [FEATURE]. Help me design the architecture: where should the logic live? What patterns work best for this codebase? Propose alternatives with trade-offs." .
```

### Architecture Review (BEFORE implementation)

```bash
gemini -m gemini-3-pro-preview "I'm planning to [CHANGE]. Review the current implementation and propose an optimal strategy. How should it integrate with existing patterns?" .
```

### Architectural Analysis Review (BEFORE presenting findings)

Use this when the user asks for architectural review/analysis and you've explored the codebase:

```bash
gemini -m gemini-3-pro-preview "I've explored [COMPONENT] architecture. Before presenting my analysis, review:

Current findings:
- [KEY OBSERVATION 1]
- [KEY OBSERVATION 2]

Questions for counter-analysis:
1. What separation of concerns issues do you see?
2. What patterns should be applied here?
3. Are there alternative architectural approaches I'm missing?
4. What are the trade-offs of the current design?

Provide a counter-analysis to ensure comprehensive review." .
```

### Code Review (AFTER implementation)

```bash
gemini -m gemini-3-pro-preview "Review my recent changes for correctness and edge cases. Focus on: [SPECIFIC AREAS]. Check for potential bugs, race conditions, and error handling." .
```

### Security Review (AFTER implementation)

```bash
gemini -m gemini-3-pro-preview "Perform a security review of [COMPONENT]. Check for: authentication issues, input validation, token handling, and OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities." .
```

### Performance Review (AFTER implementation)

```bash
gemini -m gemini-3-pro-preview "Review the performance optimization I made to [COMPONENT]. Check for: proper async/await usage, memory leaks, and concurrency issues." .
```

### Cross-Service Debug Review (WHEN debugging multi-service issues)

```bash
gemini -m gemini-3-pro-preview "Debug cross-service issue: [PROBLEM DESCRIPTION].

Services involved: [LIST SERVICES]
Data flow: [DESCRIBE EXPECTED FLOW]
Observed behavior: [WHAT'S HAPPENING]
Expected behavior: [WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN]

Analyze the data contracts between services and identify where the mismatch occurs. Recommend which service should own the fix." .
```

### Frontend/Backend Alignment Review (WHEN form data doesn't match API)

```bash
gemini -m gemini-3-pro-preview "Frontend/Backend alignment issue: [PROBLEM].

Frontend sends: [FIELDS]
Backend expects: [FIELDS]
Database schema: [RELEVANT COLUMNS]

Should the fix be:
A) Frontend explicitly sends the missing field
B) Backend derives the field from other data
C) Both with validation

Analyze both codebases and recommend specific file changes." .
```

## Integration with TDD Workflow

```
1. User requests feature
2. Claude explores codebase (Explore agent)
3. Claude calls Gemini for design review  ← BEFORE proposing
4. Claude presents options to user
5. User approves approach
6. Claude implements with TDD (Red → Green → Refactor)
7. ★ POST-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKPOINT ★
   If >100 lines OR >3 files:
   Claude calls Gemini for code review  ← IMMEDIATELY (before tests/summary)
8. Claude runs tests
9. Claude provides summary to user
10. Claude commits
```

**The checkpoint at step 7 is BLOCKING** - do not proceed to tests or summary until Gemini review is complete.

## Integration with Architectural Analysis

```
1. User requests architectural review/analysis
2. Claude explores codebase (Explore agent, Read, Grep)
3. Claude has initial findings
4. ★ CHECKPOINT: Am I about to produce recommendations? ★
5. Claude calls Gemini for counter-analysis  ← BEFORE presenting
6. Claude combines findings with Gemini's perspective
7. Claude presents comprehensive analysis to user
```

**Model enforcement**: MANDATORY `gemini-3-pro-preview`. Using any other model (gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.5-flash, etc.) is a skill violation. Fail loudly, never substitute silently.

## Failure Recovery

If Gemini invocation fails:
1. Check the model name is exactly `gemini-3-pro-preview` (no typos, no substitutions)
2. Verify the `.` context path is correct
3. Retry with a simpler prompt
4. If model is unavailable: **STOP and inform user** - do NOT fall back to another model
5. If still failing, document the failure and proceed with explicit note to user

**NEVER do this:**
```bash
# WRONG - silently using different model
gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro "..." .  # ❌ FORBIDDEN
```

## Example Session

```
User: "Add user authentication to the API"

Claude: "I'll explore the codebase first to understand the current structure."
[Uses Explore agent]

Claude: "Before proposing solutions, let me get Gemini's input on the design."
[Invokes this skill]

gemini -m gemini-3-pro-preview "I need to add user authentication to this API.
Help me design: Should auth be middleware or per-route? JWT vs sessions?
Where should user storage live? Propose alternatives with trade-offs." .

[Gemini responds with recommendations]

Claude: "Based on my exploration and Gemini's recommendations, here are the options..."
[Presents options to user]
```
